# Ink CLI Project Context Network

## Location
The context network for this project is located at: ./context-network/

## Purpose
This context network contains all planning documents, architecture decisions, design discussions, and team coordination information for Ink CLI projects. It serves as a specialized template for starting new Ink-based command-line applications with built-in LLM management and navigation capabilities, addressing the unique challenges of CLI development including React component architecture for terminals, user interaction patterns, input handling, and terminal compatibility across platforms.

## Usage Guidelines
- ALL planning documents, CLI design diagrams, and component architecture discussions MUST be stored within the context network
- Do NOT place planning or architecture documents in the project root
- Project files outside the context network should only be files consumed by build systems, package managers, or CLI end users
- Ink components, CLI entry points, and configuration files belong in the project artifact domain, not in the context network

## Navigation
See the context network's navigation guide at ./context-network/discovery.md

### Project Overview

The Ink CLI Context Network is a specialized template for starting new Ink-based command-line applications with built-in LLM management and navigation capabilities. It provides a structured approach to managing the complex web of decisions, designs, and domain knowledge that underlies React-based terminal UI development, while maintaining a clear separation between planning artifacts (context network) and implementation code (app/ directory).

### Vision Statement

To transform Ink CLI development by creating a seamless bridge between human developers, AI agents, and project knowledge, enabling teams to navigate the evolving terminal UI ecosystem and build more maintainable, comprehensible, and evolvable React-based command-line applications.

### Mission Statement

The Ink CLI Context Network template provides development teams with a structured knowledge management system that captures the "why" behind CLI design decisions, preserves institutional knowledge about component architecture and user interaction patterns, facilitates onboarding to complex terminal applications, and enables AI-assisted development through clear separation of planning and implementation artifacts.

### Project Objectives

1. Provide a specialized context network structure optimized for Ink CLI projects
2. Establish clear patterns for documenting CLI architecture decisions, component selections, and user interaction design choices
3. Create navigation paths tailored to CLI development roles and terminal UI-specific tasks
4. Enable effective collaboration between human developers and AI agents in the Ink ecosystem
5. Reduce knowledge silos around component architecture, input handling, and terminal compatibility patterns
6. Document decision-making processes for the evolving terminal UI ecosystem
7. Preserve institutional knowledge about CLI user experience design and terminal rendering optimization

### Success Criteria

1. Reduced time to first meaningful contribution for new developers
2. Decreased frequency of "archaeology" requests (digging for lost knowledge)
3. Improved documentation coverage of major components
4. Higher decision traceability percentage
5. Increased documentation update frequency relative to code changes
6. Greater developer confidence in making changes
7. Better stakeholder understanding of system state
8. Reduction in repeated mistakes

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Context network structure specialized for Ink CLI development
- Templates for CLI architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Ink component and terminal UI documentation patterns
- CLI-specific process documentation templates
- Terminal UI ecosystem technical debt tracking mechanisms
- Navigation guides for CLI development roles and Ink-specific workflows
- Integration patterns with Ink project structures and package.json
- Maintenance strategies for keeping documentation in sync with CLI code
- Component architecture decision templates (layout, input handling, rendering)
- Terminal compatibility and user experience decision frameworks
- CLI distribution and installation configuration guidance
- User interaction design and accessibility strategy documentation

#### Out of Scope

- Actual Ink/React implementation code (belongs in app/ directory)
- Specific CLI boilerplate or starter code
- Pre-configured build systems or bundlers
- Specific testing framework implementations
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline configurations
- Specific project management methodologies
- Package.json files or node_modules (belongs in app/ directory)

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| CLI Developers | Use the context network alongside Ink CLI development | CLI development teams |
| UI/UX Architects | Document CLI user experience and terminal UI architectural decisions | CLI design teams |
| Technical Leads | Ensure alignment between context network and Ink CLI implementation | CLI team leads |
| New Team Members | Learn about the CLI project through the context network | Onboarding CLI developers |
| AI Agents | Navigate and update the context network based on Ink CLI interactions | LLM assistants with CLI knowledge |
| End Users | Provide feedback on CLI usability and user experience | CLI application users |

### Timeline

This is a template project without specific timeline milestones. Each Ink CLI implementation will have its own timeline.

### Constraints

- Must work with existing LLM agent capabilities and limitations
- Should be compatible with standard version control systems (Git)
- Must be Ink CLI and terminal UI ecosystem focused
- Should not require specialized tools beyond text editors, LLM agents, and Ink tooling
- Must maintain separation between context network and app/ directory
- Should work with common terminal environments and CLI development workflows

### Assumptions

- Development teams will maintain discipline in separating planning from implementation artifacts
- LLM agents will have sufficient context window to process relevant parts of the network
- Teams will regularly update the context network alongside code changes
- The context network will be stored in the same repository as the code or in a linked repository

### Risks

- Context network may become outdated if not maintained alongside code
- Teams may struggle with the discipline of separating planning from implementation
- LLM context limitations may restrict the ability to process the entire network
- Over-documentation could slow down development velocity
- Under-documentation could reduce the value of the context network
